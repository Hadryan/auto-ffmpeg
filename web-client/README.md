### web-client ###

This is very basic web based client for put job for this ffmpeg cluster. Clearly there's many thing to be done here.
I use basic example of html5 template from w3school, no session, no credential, no security protection since it's just use in internal environment.

Todo :
- more security (session/credential)
- ability to manage queue
- ability to see realtime progress from ffmpeg worker
